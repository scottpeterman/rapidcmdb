## ‚ú® Transform Network Auditing

**Transform weeks of manual network auditing into hours of automated intelligence.**

**Before RapidCMDB**: üìã Manual spreadsheets, incomplete inventories, outdated topology maps  
**After RapidCMDB**: üéØ Automated discovery, real-time monitoring, accurate CMDB

RapidCMDB is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** demonstrating an innovative approach to rapidly gain deep insight into network environments that may lack an accurate Configuration Management Database (CMDB) through automated discovery and data collection. While currently designed for **single-user deployment** as an early release, it offers highly useful capabilities for efficient network asset management and reconciliation.

### Key Results
- **65k+ hosts scanned** in minutes with `/16` network support
- **Enterprise SNMPv3** with SHA256/AES256 encryption support
- **Multi-vendor support** (Cisco, Aruba, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Juniper, Dell, HP, and more)
- **Real-time topology** with LLDP-based mapping and bidirectional consistency
- **Zero-touch** NAPALM compatibility analysis for automation planning
- **Concurrent processing** with intelligent rate limiting and timeout scaling

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

RapidCMDB implements a sophisticated, multi-stage data ingestion pipeline designed for enterprise-grade network asset management:

### Stage 1: High-Speed Network Discovery (`gosnmptk` scanner)

The discovery engine utilizes an optimized Go-based SNMP toolkit for enterprise-scale, low-impact network scanning:

- **Enterprise Performance**: Capable of scanning `/16` networks (65k+ hosts) in minutes
- **Intelligent Scanning Strategy**: Initial TCP port scans on standard network device ports, followed by detailed SNMP fingerprinting only on responsive hosts
- **Dynamic Performance Tuning**: Automatic timeout scaling based on network size and device response times
- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable concurrency (up to 200+ operations) with intelligent rate limiting
- **Extensible Fingerprinting Engine**: Driven by configurable `vendor_fingerprints.yaml` with:
  - **Vendor-Specific Profiles**: Detailed detection patterns for 20+ major vendors
  - **Prioritized OID Queries**: Optimized OID selection for model, version, and serial extraction
  - **Exclusion Patterns**: Prevents misclassification between similar vendors
  - **Configurable Timeouts**: Tunable performance parameters for different network conditions

**Output**: Structured JSON files with comprehensive device metadata

### Stage 2: Data Import & Deduplication (`db_scan_import.py`)

Processes raw discovery data into the core SQLite CMDB with intelligent normalization:

- **Device Key Generation**: SHA256 hashing of vendor|serial|model for stable identification
- **Enhanced Data Extraction**: Smart serial number and model parsing from system descriptions
- **Automated Classification**: Site code extraction and device role assignment
- **Deduplication Logic**: Prevents duplicate entries while updating existing records
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Vendor, device type, site, and confidence-based filtering

### Stage 3: Detailed Collection (`npcollector1.py`)

Concurrent NAPALM-based data collection for comprehensive device intelligence:

- **Dynamic Driver Selection**: Intelligent NAPALM driver mapping based on device characteristics
- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: 
  - Device facts (hostname, OS, uptime, hardware details)
  - Full configurations (running, startup, candidate)
  - Network data (interfaces, LLDP, ARP, MAC tables, routing)
  - Hardware inventory with detailed component information
  - Environmental monitoring (CPU, memory, temperature, power)
  - Optical transceiver metrics and user account information
- **Concurrent Processing**: ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient multi-device collection
- **Local Archive**: Structured storage in `captures/` directory for raw data preservation

### Stage 4: Database Integration (`db_manager.py`)

Imports detailed collection data into the comprehensive CMDB schema:

- **Robust Schema**: 12+ tables covering devices, interfaces, topology, environment, configurations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete collection run tracking with success/failure metrics
- **Change Detection**: Automatic configuration hash comparison for change tracking
- **Trigger Automation**: Database triggers for topology auto-population
- **CLI Operations**: Command-line utilities for database management and reporting

### Database Schema Highlights

**Core Tables**:
- `devices` - Primary device inventory with vendor, model, serial, role
- `interfaces` - Physical and logical interface details with IP assignments
- `lldp_neighbors` - Network topology data with interface normalization
- `collection_runs` - Audit trail with detailed success/failure tracking
- `device_configs` - Configuration storage with change detection
- `environment_data` - Hardware health metrics and environmental monitoring

**Advanced Features**:
- **Data Integrity**: SQL constraints for VLAN ranges, MAC formats, CPU usage validation
- **Temporal Tracking**: Automatic timestamp management with triggers
- **JSON Storage**: Flexible vendor-specific data accommodation
- **Optimized Indexing**: Strategic indexes for device lookups and time-series queries
